Loop Forever
	Monitor sound and vibration parameters
	If sound is greater than threshold sound, or vibration is greater than threshold vibration: // this block will run if the machine is making enough noise or vibrating enough
		Set status to "in use"
		Send status information to web server
		Display "IN USE"
	Else // this block will run in the machine is not making sufficient noise or vibrations to be recognized as "in use"
		Begin timer
		While timer is lower than threshold time: // loops for 10/20 mins (sufficient amount of time that will be finetuned over test phase)
			Monitor sound and vibration parameters
			If sound is greater than threshold sound, and vibration is greater than threshold vibration // this block will run if the machine is making enough noise or vibrating enough
				Return to line 4
			Update timer
		Set status to "available" // this will run if machine is quiet and still for 10/20 mins
		Send status information to web server
		Display "AVAILABLE"
